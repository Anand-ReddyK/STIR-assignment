# Scraper Project

## Overview
Built a web scraper using Selenium to automate data extraction from Twitter (X). The scraper uses ProxyMesh for secure and anonymous browsing by connecting to a proxy server through its host and port after adding our IP address. 
The scraper logs into Twitter fetches the trending topics, and stores the extracted data in a MongoDB database.

Developed a simple Flask application to serve as the backend for a web page that displays the scraped results.
